    <h1><center><p style="color:#142995;">The Snake survival game is a python game where the player plays as a snake. The main goal of the game is to beat the high score. In order to do so, the player has to move the snake with the arrow keys. If the snake eats the apples it grows bigger and your score goes up. To get to the apples(which are randomly placed) the player has to avoid running into the walls or the snake itself. If you do, then its game over and the game restarts. Overall its a classic game that's fun to play! Can you beat the high score?</h1>

    <h1><center><p style="color:#142995;">Our group made a dodgeball game. The player is moved with WASD keys. The goal is to avoid the balls that randomly bounce around the court. If you collide with a ball, you lose one of your three lives. If you lose all three lives, you lose the game and it displays how long you stayed alive for (timer).</h1>
